Analysis of Wall Street stock data with Visual Basic in MS Excel.

---

There are currently four main files available:

1) The_VBA_of_Wall_Street.bas : basic code for the macro.
2) 2014_solved.png : screen shot of solved sheet for 2014 data
3) 2015_solved.png : screen shot of solved sheet for 2015 data
4) 2015_solved.png: screen shot of solved for 2016 data

All code was written by Corey D. Anderson. The procedure for iterating over each sheet was inspired from an answer on Stackoverflow (by Heather Claxton):
