VBA code for The VBA of Wall Street assignment

This repository contains VBA code and source data for the VBA Homework assignment ("The VBA of Wall Street") for the Georgia Teach Data Science and Analytics Bootcamp

There are currently four main files available:

1) The_VBA_of_Wall_Street.bas : basic code for the macro.
2) 2014_solved.png : screen shot of solved sheet for 2014 data
3) 2015_solved.png : screen shot of solved sheet for 2015 data
4) 2015_solved.png: screen shot of solved for 2016 data

All code was written by Corey D. Anderson. The procedure for iterating over each sheet was inspired from an answer on Stackoverflow (by Heather Claxton):
